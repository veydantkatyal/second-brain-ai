# Second Brain AI

Second Brain AI is an open-source research assistant inspired by Notion, built by fine-tuning the **LLaMA 3.1 (8B)** model using **Unsloth AI**. It aims to act as your second brain—helping you organize, summarize, and generate high-quality research notes seamlessly.

## Project Overview

This project leverages Unsloth's optimized fine-tuning techniques to transform Meta’s LLaMA model into a Notion-style assistant. The model is designed to assist with:

- Context-aware note-taking
- Intelligent summarization
- Research question answering
- Personalized content generation

All within a lightweight and efficient fine-tuned LLM.
